<!-- Meta Description
	Meta descriptions are HTML attributes that provide concise explanations of the contents of web pages. Meta descriptions are commonly used on search engine result pages (SERPs) to display preview snippets for a given page.

	Meta descriptions can be any length, but search engines generally truncate snippets longer than 160 characters. It is best to keep meta descriptions between 150 and 160 characters.

<!-- Mobile Icon (Home Screen Icon)
	The easiest way to add a single icon that suits both types of iPhone screens (standard resolution and Retina Display) and iPad screens
	is to create a single PNG image with the dimensions 180 x 180 pixels. The filename for the PNG image must be: apple-touch-icon.png.
	You must then upload your new file to the root directory of your website.

<!-- Open Graph Meta
	The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph. For instance, this is used on Facebook to allow any web page to have the same functionality as any other object on Facebook. More information: http://ogp.me/

<!-- Include CSS Files
	Make sure you load your custom files last, if you want to overwrite the theme styles. This way you won't have issues with specificity. We recommend you create custom.css
	and all you custom styles inside that file. Making changes to your own separate file will allow you to update the theme without issues.

        <h1>The Product</h1>
        <p class="portfolio-single-description">The product is a cloud based dementia and therapy engagement platform for the senior care market. It enhances the quality of life in senior communities by keeping seniors, especially those with dementia, engaged to maintain a higher level of cognitive function.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p class="portfolio-single-description">The product was conceptualized originally as an MP3 player pre-filled with a list of musical content. Since its initial launch in 2011, content has been added in a variety of formats such as videos, games, trivia, pictures and more. Therefore, the content has grown by orders of magnitude without any guidelines or redesign in structure or presentation. Vast supply of content combined with poorly defined structure led to the ineffectiveness of the tool with community staff members, our primary users.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p class="portfolio-single-description">In order to create an efficient tool that not only engages residents but also fosters collaboration among staff members and residents’ family members we completely overhauled the content structure, simplified the flow for all types of staff members, implemented a family-friendly feature as well as initialized a redesign of the interface to ensure specifications were met for the elderly population. </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2>Got the Brief</h2>
        <p class="portfolio-single-description">I was very eager to work with my two teammates as I felt we were all a very good fit for each other. First team meeting we discussed why each of us were interested in this particular project and quickly found that this product touched each of our hearts on a personal level. We also learned which areas of the UX process were our strengths as well as what areas of concentration we each would prefer to learn more about by doing.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2>Meet The Client</h2>
        <p class="portfolio-single-description">Eager to begin our work we met with our client immediately and thanks to some demonstrations of the product in its current state, we had a very good understanding of how large the scope of this project really was. It was at this point, I could see clearly that having two fantastic researchers on my team suited me just fine as I wanted to concentrate on the architecture as well as the interface design.</p>
      </div>
       </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2>Hit the Streets</h2>
        <p class="portfolio-single-description">One of the reasons ALL of us were excited about this project was the opportunity we saw to meet with, interview and study our users as they used the product. With a tightening of his tie Jay set off to visit nearby assisted living facilities to deliver a survey we created intended for nurses and activity directors. Unfortunately our attempts to connect with our users were met with great resistance due to the nature of the business of health care. </p>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2>Meanwhile Back at Head Quarters</h2>
        <p class="portfolio-single-description">Liz buckled down and a buried herself deep into the rabbit whole that is research of the brain and I connected with two of our main competitors to analysis their systems. In the realm of software as a service most of our competitors would not allow a preview of the system without being a paying client, therefore much of the analysis had to come from video and screenshots of interfaces. One competitor however was more than happy to provide their results from extensive clinical research validating their product against their mission. This information led us to the discovery of one of the many areas of improvement for our client. </p>

        <h2>Gadget Guru to the Rescue</h2>
        <p class="portfolio-single-description">The product is a web based app intended for use on tablets as well as large kiosks; thanks to our resident Gadget Guru I was able to explore the online portal on three devices in order to ensure I had a thorough understanding of current experience. This also ensured that our future designs would work seamlessly across multiple devices.</p>

        <h2>Post-It Prodigy</h2>
        <p class="portfolio-single-description">As my teammates were delving into greater depths of the rest of the experience that needed revamping, I jumped at the opportunity to go through every screen and every category of the entire current system.  In the time-lapse video here each Post-It represents a category of content listed with the number of pieces of content within said category. As you can see it is a massive library of content. </p>

        <p class="portfolio-single-description">This process also highlighted the paths to this vast amount of content was very unclear, convoluted, tedious and inefficient, to say the least.  After thoroughly documenting my work and with the help of a fellow colleague, we destroyed the old system, quite literally.</p>

        <h2>One Level Deep</h2>
        <p class="portfolio-single-description">Starting with a blank white board, I began with the highest level of architecture and worked my way down simplifying the entire system. The most important goal of this new architecture schema was to ensure that content was never more than one level deep. All content would be organized in a similar pattern so that finding content was consistent no matter what you were looking for.</p>

        <p class="portfolio-single-description">As I began wire framing pages content categories, Liz and Jay provided ample research on designing for the elderly, especially concentrating on those who have any sort of disability, which greatly influenced all of my designs.  Most notable is the navigation location, which is flipped on its axis -- all resident facing controls are placed at the bottom of the screen and building up as needed.</p>

        <p class="portfolio-single-description">With only a few days left in our 2.5 week sprint we were able to put our working prototype in front our client’s CEO. It was only after this meeting and thanks to the CEO’s satisfaction of our direction and skills that we were finally able to reach and test with an actual current client. We received very positive feedback from both the CEO and CTO, as well as some clarity as to the direction that the company is currently heading.</p>

        <p class="portfolio-single-description">Coming up with the variety of ways to display content within our app was a team effort at all times. As much as we worked independently we were always gathering into a mini design studio and flushing out ideas through constant iteration.  As new ideas came to light I would jump back on the computer to mock them up and integrate them into our working prototype.</p>

        <p class="portfolio-single-description">2 weeks into our 2.5 week sprint and we finally meet a real user. Due to precarious relationships between our client and their clients we were denied access to actual client testing.  It wasn’t until we finally had a chance to put the prototype in front of the CEO who was so approving that he actually set up a date and time for us to meet with an actual client of theirs. This test, albeit late in the game, still added value to our prototype as well as feedback for additional changes to the overall experience.</p>

        <p class="portfolio-single-description">We received resounding praise from our client both at the presentation and when we delivered our recommendation document, additional materials, and our prototype. As thorough of a job as we did within 2.5 weeks there is ample opportunity for further exploration into this experience. As of this writing it is unknown how much of our advice and direction our client will implement, I look forward to seeing the release of the next version in the future. </p>
